## Google Analytics and Ad revenue CLI project

This was a simple CLI project that I made to practice C# and Dotnet. I used this to get some analytics report of some sites at my day job so I can see how much ad revenue and users each site has plus a few other sites. This project won't actually work anymore because the ad dashboard account doesn't exist. There's a lot of hardcoded stuff in here as well because the goal of this wasn't some super secure CLI app, it was just a helper CLI command that I ran from my terminal every now and then.
